My major challenge was making the images fit the 12 columns without making them too big. The images in the mockup take all 12 columns and looked fine, but when I gave them 12 columns when building the website, they were just too big and I had to reduce the number of columns allocated to each image.

The other challenge I had was giving the contact form a dark background and making it fit the form without shrinking it.
